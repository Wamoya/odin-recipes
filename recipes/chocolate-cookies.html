            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These chocolate chocolate chip cookies are made with cocoa powder and chocolate chips to guarantee chocolaty flavor in every bite.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Sugar:             </strong> The recipe starts with 1 Â½ cups white sugar.</li>
                <li> <strong>Butter:            </strong> Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.</li>
                <li> <strong>Eggs:              </strong> Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
                <li> <strong>Vanilla:           </strong> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies.</li>
                <li> <strong>Flour:             </strong> All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure.</li>
                <li> <strong>Cocoa powder:      </strong> They wouldn't be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!</li>
                <li> <strong>Baking soda:       </strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
                <li> <strong>Salt:              </strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
                <li> <strong>Chocolate chips:   </strong> You'll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips.</li>
                <li> <strong>Walnuts (optional):</strong> Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all the ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Beat sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl until light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in another bowl; stir into butter mixture until well blended.</li>
                <li>Mix in chocolate chips and walnuts. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until set, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool slightly on the cookie sheets before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
