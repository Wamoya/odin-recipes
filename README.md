# Odin project: Recipes

> **From TheOdinProject**
> 
> It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.
> 
> The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

## What does this project represent?
This is my first project regarding the TOP curriculum.
By completing it, I will demonstrate basic knowledge of HTML by also applying a git workflow.
